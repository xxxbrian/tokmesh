//! Command Code session parser
//!
//! Parses JSONL transcripts from `~/.commandcode/projects/<slug>/<session>.jsonl`.
//!
//! Command Code's on-disk transcript (version 3) is a stream of typed JSON
//! records, one per line:
//!
//! - `{"type":"session","version":3,"id":"<session>",...}` — the header, which
//!   carries the session id that every message line also repeats.
//! - `{"type":"message","id":...,"timestamp":...,"message":{"role":...,"content":[...]},"usage":{...},"model":"provider/model"}` —
//!   conversation entries. Assistant responses carry an authoritative `usage`
//!   block (`inputTokens`, `outputTokens`, `cacheReadTokens`,
//!   `cacheWriteTokens`, `costUsd`) plus the `model` in effect for that call.
//! - `{"type":"model_change","timestamp":...,"model":"provider/model"}` —
//!   mid-session model switches.
//!
//! Unlike earlier versions of this parser (which assumed Command Code never
//! persisted usage locally and estimated tokens at ~4 chars/token from message
//! text), the v3 transcript DOES persist per-request usage and cost. When a
//! message line carries a `usage` block, its token counts and `costUsd` are
//! used verbatim and marked provider-reported, so the cost is not overwritten
//! by tokscale's estimated pricing. The usage buckets are DISJOINT:
//! `inputTokens` is cache-exclusive and `cacheReadTokens`/`cacheWriteTokens`
//! are billed on top of it — the vendor's own cost arithmetic reproduces the
//! recorded `costUsd` exactly only when the full `inputTokens` is charged at
//! the input rate plus the cache buckets, so no subtraction is applied. Lines
//! without `usage` (user turns, tool results) contribute nothing themselves —
//! the assistant turn that follows them carries the full request accounting.
//!
//! The transcript is a TREE, not a log: `/rewind` moves the leaf pointer
//! backwards and `persistEntry` is append-only, so orphaned assistant entries
//! keep their `usage` on disk but are NOT on the active branch. The vendor
//! counts only `getBranch()` (the parent chain from the last entry), and this
//! parser matches that by dropping messages whose entry id is not on the
//! active branch. `/fork`/`/clone` copies entries into a new session file
//! leaving the original; the per-entry `id` + `timestamp` dedup key collapses
//! those copies across files.
//!
//! Legacy flat-schema transcripts (`{"role":..., "content":..., ...}` with no
//! `type`/`message` nesting) are still parsed via the ~4 chars/token estimation
//! fallback, using the configured agent model from `~/.commandcode/config.json`.
//!
//! The model id is read from the line's own `model` field, falling back to the
//! most recent `model_change` event, then to `~/.commandcode/config.json` (the
//! configured agent model), then to "unknown". Gateway ids such as
//! `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M3-Free` have their org prefix dropped for pricing
//! (the provider hint is recovered from the RAW id before stripping), but the
//! `-Free` suffix is preserved — `poolside/laguna-s-2.1-free` is a real
//! catalog id, so stripping it would invent a nonexistent model.
