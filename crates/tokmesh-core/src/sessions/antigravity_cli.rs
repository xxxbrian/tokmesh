//! Antigravity CLI session parser
//!
//! The Antigravity CLI (the terminal agent, distinct from the Antigravity IDE)
//! stores each conversation as a SQLite database under
//! `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/conversations/<uuid>.db`. Unlike the IDE-backed
//! [`super::antigravity`] source — which depends on a *running* language server
//! reachable over RPC and caches JSONL under the config dir — the CLI usage is
//! already on disk and can be read directly. No RPC, no `antigravity sync`.
//!
//! Each `gen_metadata` row is one generation encoded as the same
//! `GeneratorMetadata` protobuf the IDE returns over
//! `GetCascadeTrajectoryGeneratorMetadata`. The repository has no `.proto` /
//! prost decoder (the IDE path receives JSON because the language server does
//! the proto→JSON conversion), so this module ships a tiny wire-format reader
//! and pulls only the few fields it needs. The field numbers below were
//! reverse-engineered from real databases and cross-checked across 6 sessions
//! / 140 turns (`#9 + #10 == #3`, i.e. output + thinking == total output;
//! `#5`/cacheRead only appears once a cached prefix exists and grows with the
//! conversation):
//!
//! - `gen_metadata.#1`            → chatModel message
//!   - `#19` (string, optional)  → responseModel (e.g. `gemini-3-flash-a`)
//!   - `#21` (string, optional)  → model display label (`Gemini 3.6 Flash (High)`)
//!   - `#9` (message)            → per-generation wall-clock time. Two layouts
//!     exist depending on the agy version, both handled by
//!     `generation_timestamp_ms`:
//!     - agy ≤ 1.1.17: `#9.#4` = `{#1: seconds, #2: nanos}` Timestamp.
//!     - agy 1.1.18: `#4` is gone. `#9` instead carries `#2` = `u64::MAX` (an
//!       `int64` -1 "unset" sentinel, never a time) and a new `#10` holding 8
//!       length-delimited bytes. Unlike every other field number here, `#10`'s
//!       encoding was *not* read off a real database — it is inferred from a
//!       field dump in issue #1184 — so each candidate reading is range-checked
//!       *and* pinned to the lifetime of the session that contains it before it
//!       is accepted, and is declined outright when that lifetime is unknown —
//!       i.e. `trajectory_metadata_blob` held no decodable created-at. An
//!       absolute "is this a believable date" window is not a meaningful test
//!       for eight opaque bytes: read as a nanosecond count it alone covers
//!       roughly 2% of the `u64` range, so trying both byte orders leaves an
//!       arbitrary payload (an id, a hash, a duration) a few percent
//!       chance of passing as a date. Constraining it to the session's own span
//!       cuts that by orders of magnitude, because a turn cannot happen before
//!       the conversation it belongs to nor after the moment we read the file.
//!   - `#4`                      → usage message
//!     - `#1` (varint, const)    → fixed system-prompt tokens (≈1132)
//!     - `#2` (varint)           → newly-processed (non-cached) input tokens
//!     - `#5` (varint)           → cacheRead tokens
//!     - `#9` (varint)           → output (text) tokens
//!     - `#10` (varint)          → thinking / reasoning tokens
//!     - `#11` (string)          → responseId (dedup key)
//! - `trajectory_metadata_blob.#2` = `{#1: seconds, #2: nanos}` → created-at
//! - `trajectory_metadata_blob.#1.#1` (string)                  → workspace URI
//!
//! `#19` is optional in practice: some continuation turns omit it while still
//! writing `#21`. `SessionModels` recovers the machine id for those rows from
//! the rest of the same conversation. `#21` was present on every row observed so
//! far, including the ones missing `#19`, but nothing here requires it — a row
//! carrying neither field is handled too. `#21` serves only as a join key
//! between rows of one file and is never used as a pricing key: it is a
//! server-supplied name that gets renamed (`Gemini 3 Flash` → `Gemini 3.5 Flash
//! (High)`) and could be localized.

///    The two byte orders are played off against each other on their unit
///    ranges alone, *before* the session window is consulted, and the
///    plausibility band those ranges are cut from is a fixed [2020, 2100]
///    bracket that never reads the clock. Either clock input would make the
///    same bytes read differently on different days: a reading that was
///    unrivalled while its mirror still lay beyond the horizon would turn

///    the horizon reached the mirror. The scan clock enters exactly once,
