//! Shared driver for the OpenCode SQLite session schema.
//!
//! OpenCode, MiMo Code, and Kilo all persist assistant turns as a JSON payload
//! in a `data` column keyed by `(id, session_id)`. The payloads share one
//! schema — `modelID` / `providerID` / `tokens.{input,output,reasoning,cache}`
//! / `time.{created,completed}` — so this module owns a single set of
//! `Deserialize` types and a single row-ingest loop for all three, instead of
//! each client re-declaring the schema and re-implementing the loop.
//!
//! The clients differ only in *policy* (which tables exist, how duplicates
//! collapse, whether epochs are seconds or milliseconds, which fallbacks
//! apply). Every such difference is an explicit field on
//! [`OpenCodeSchemaConfig`], which is `Copy` and built from a per-client
//! `const fn` constructor. The driver is a plain `fn` taking that config by
//! value rather than a generic over the message type or the row callback:
//! generics would monomorphize per client and *grow* the binary, which is the
//! opposite of the point.
