//! Antigravity subscription quota.
//!
//! Unlike every other provider here, this one never reaches a cloud API. The
//! Antigravity CLI (`agy`) and IDE both run a language server that holds the
//! OAuth token, calls Google Code Assist, caches the answer, and exposes it
//! over a loopback Connect-RPC endpoint. `/usage` inside the CLI reads exactly
//! that:
//!
//! ```text
//! POST http://127.0.0.1:<port>/exa.language_server_pb.LanguageServerService/RetrieveUserQuotaSummary
//! Connect-Protocol-Version: 1
//! {}
//! ```
//!
//! No CSRF token is required for this method, and tokscale never has to hold
//! an Antigravity credential of its own — the token stays inside the language
//! server and we only read the numbers it already computed.
//!
//! Calling Google's `cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/v1internal:retrieveUserQuota`
//! directly was tried first and rejected: authentication succeeds, but a
//! `GEMINI_CLI` client identity is answered with `UNSUPPORTED_CLIENT` /
//! `SUBSCRIPTION_REQUIRED` now that individual users have been migrated to
//! Antigravity.
//!
//! Antigravity meters quota **per model group** — Gemini models share one
//! weekly and one five-hour limit, Claude and GPT models share another — so
//! this provider emits one [`UsageOutput`] per group and names the group in
//! the account label. That reuses the existing multi-output path (the same one
//! Codex uses for multiple accounts) and renders as
//! `Antigravity (Gemini Models)`, rather than flattening every bucket into one
//! list where no row can be attributed to a group.

/// Deadline for one round of candidate requests.
///
/// What this replaces was 400ms *per candidate*, applied to a full quota
/// request. It read as a probe bound, but it was also the only gate on
/// availability: [`has_credentials`] reports a language server as present
/// exactly when one answers a quota summary, and `usage/mod.rs` drops a
/// provider from the report before any fetch runs when it does not. A language
/// server on a loaded machine pushes a loopback round trip well past 400ms, so
/// the bound written to abandon *wrong* ports was abandoning the right one
/// (#1280).
///
/// Asking the candidates together is what makes the longer bound affordable. A
/// port nothing is listening on refuses the connection outright, so a machine
/// without Antigravity never approaches this, and a port that accepts and then
/// goes quiet is waited on once for the round rather than once per candidate.
///
/// A *round*, not the whole of discovery. [`discover_quota`] has two candidate
/// sources and each gets its own round, computed when that round starts, so
/// the requests can cost twice this in total. One instant shared across both
/// was worse than that arithmetic: a first source that spent it handed the
/// second an expired deadline, and `tokio::time::timeout_at` resolves an
/// expired deadline by polling once and dropping the task set, so the second
/// source's requests were abandoned before a socket was opened. Neither round
/// covers [`crate::antigravity::detect_antigravity_connections`], which is
/// synchronous and carries per-socket timeouts of its own.
///
/// Bounded at all because usage providers share a fan-out: whatever this
/// spends is spent by the whole `tokmesh usage` report. 10s across both
/// rounds sits well inside the 12s-30s the cloud-backed providers here allow
/// themselves, and leaves a healthy loopback answer -- milliseconds when idle,
/// low seconds on a loaded machine -- several times the room it needs.
///
/// This is also how long a round waits for a *better-ranked* candidate once it
/// holds an answer from a worse one. [`ports_from_cli_log`] yields candidates
/// newest first, because the last port the log names is the current server,
/// and an older entry can still be answered by a stale `agy` left over from a
/// restart or an account switch, whose quota is another account's or nobody's
/// (signed out, which parses fine and reports as "not signed in"). So a round
/// keeps the best-ranked answer it has seen and returns the moment nothing
/// better can still arrive. What it is waiting on until then is the current
/// server -- the server this budget was sized for -- so there is no shorter
/// grace for that wait. An earlier revision cut it at 2s from the first answer,
/// which contradicted the premise above: a current server answering in 2-5s on
/// a loaded machine lost to a stale sibling that answered at once. The cost of
/// a single bound is confined to a newest logged port that accepts and then
/// goes quiet while an older one still answers: that round runs to its
/// deadline before believing the older answer, which is the worst case one
/// stalled candidate already costs.
