//!
//! The Antigravity and Trae sync locks both record the owning PID and evict a
//! lock only once that owner is provably dead. A wrong answer in the
//! permissive direction lets two syncs run against the same manifest and
//! delete each other's session artifacts, so every uncertain result here
//! resolves to "alive" and merely defers a sync.
//!
//! Each platform backend answers with a [`Probe`] rather than a bool, and only
//! `Probe::Absent` — the OS positively reporting an unused PID — releases a
//! lock. Routing every backend through one verdict is what stops the
//! fail-alive policy from being re-decided, differently, inside each `cfg`
//! block.
//!
//! The classification is split from the FFI so it can be unit-tested
//! off-platform. CI runs no Windows job, so a Windows-only `pid_is_alive`
//! would otherwise ship with its policy never executed; the pure classifiers
//! below are compiled and asserted on every host that runs the suite.
//!
//! The two callers previously carried separate copies of this probe that had
//! already drifted — Antigravity's comment defended the no-overlap invariant
//! while Trae's waived it — and both were Unix-only. One module keeps the
//! policy in a single place.
